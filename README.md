## Project Summary

This study seeks to use the Archives Leadership Institute as a case study to 1) explore, in
depth, what cohort members have taken away from their experiences since their initial
participation; 2) what the leadership team and faculty intended for participants to take away, and
how that may have evolved over time; 3) what outcomes applicants for the institute hoped to
gain from the experience; and 4) to identify a set of characteristics that can be used for building
future cohorts and capacity in the archival field. The central aim of this project is to build upon a
common vocabulary of useful concepts for assisting archivists with their journeys of professional
development, and to use those concepts to build new sustainable professional programs. Using
the five stage Digital Preservation Management (DPM) model developed in 2001 by Anne
Kenney and Nancy McGovern as a way to initially situate, map, and understand this case study,
will allow for further development and testing against this existing organizational maturity model
for understanding and informing capacity building in the archival field. Interviews, surveys, and
existing data will be used to identify successful traits and actionable ideas for fostering healthy
archival cohorts and communities that have the capacity for sustaining vital local and national
infrastructures to support preservation and access.
